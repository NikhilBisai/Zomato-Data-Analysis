## 🍽 Zomato Data Analysis — Real-World Data Insights with Python

This project showcases my ability to extract and communicate meaningful insights from real-world restaurant data using Python and essential data science libraries. It’s a full-cycle analysis, from raw data to actionable visualizations, aimed at understanding customer behavior, pricing trends, and regional preferences across Zomato listings.

### ✅ Objectives

- Demonstrate end-to-end data analysis using industry-relevant tools
- Gain insights into user preferences, pricing trends, and restaurant performance
- Build compelling visual narratives to support data-driven decisions

### 📈 Key Contributions

- **Data Cleaning & Wrangling:** Addressed missing data, duplicates, and anomalies for consistent analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified key patterns in rating distributions, cuisine popularity, and price categories
- **Visualization:** Used **Matplotlib** to design visually intuitive graphs that support storytelling
- **Insight Generation:** Discovered city-wise food trends, consumer preferences, and platform-based behavior (e.g. online orders)
